      <h3>Using Dygraphs to load down-sampled data while zooming <small> - Example 1</small></h3>

      <p>In the example below, new data is loaded every time the user zooms in on the graph. This provides an overall
        view of the entire possible data set via the range selector below the graph, but allows interactive drill down
        in to more detailed views of the data without having to load the entire data set at the
        start. For very large data sets, loading all the data from the start is not practical.</p>

      <p>The shaded areas above and below the solid line indicate min/max values whenever the data is being
        down-sampled, and in this case, the solid line indicates the average value. As the user zooms in,
        eventually there are no min/max indicators because the raw data values are being displayed.</p>

      <h3>How it works</h3>

      <p>
        On page load, two data requests are sent to the server. One for the "range" data, and one for the
        "detail" data. When zooming, a new request is made for more detailed data according to the new
        zoom extents (or "dateWindow" in Dygraphs terminology.)
      </p>

      <p>
        When the new detail data set is received, the code in GraphDataProvider.js splices it with the previously loaded
        range data set to generate a single new "spliced data set". This spliced data set is what is given to
        Dygraphs for drawing.</p>

      <div>
        <image src="i/datalayout.png" width="576" height="130" />
      </div>

      <p>This allows Dygraphs to draw and support the range selector control, but also draw the more
        detailed data in the zoom window currently being viewed. The non-zoomed, more down-sampled, data can be seen
        while dragging the range selector because the code does not initiate a new detail data load until
        mouse-up.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <strong>key to this approach is in understanding the different ways the zoom window (dateWindow) can be
        changed in Dygraphs</strong> and the different results from each interaction. Interactions causing dateWindow to
        be changed include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A - Dragging on the range selector handles - Causes multiple zoomCallbacks while the position of the handle
          is changing
        </li>
        <li>B - Dragging the range selector to move the dateWindow - No zoomCallback</li>
        <li>C - Click-dragging on the graph to zoom - Causes a single zoomCallback</li>
        <li>D - Click-dragging while holding Shift to pan - No zoomCallback, and not handled in this demo. Handling this
          requires additional complexity that I'll show in a future example.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        To handle these interactions, the code installs a mouse-down and subsequent mouse-up listener on the
        range selector. (It also installs corresponding touch event listeners so this works on tablets.) When
        a mouse down occurs on the range selector, the code tracks it and ignores all subsequent zoomCallbacks. This
        handles (A). We initiate the data load on mouse-up. This handles (A) and (B). If there was no mouse-down on
        the range selector and we get a zoomCallback, then we assume (C), and so initiate an immediate data load. Handling (D)
        requires hooking in to the drawCallback and is not shown in this example.
      </p>

      <p>That's basically it. The code, and comments in the code, shows the details.</p>

      <h4>Third party libraries</h4>

      <p>
        I used jQuery because it simplifies the code and, honestly, I've probably started forgetting how to work with
        DOM events correctly without it. I also used two other third party libraries that are not required, but
        made this example a little better. Both can be easily removed.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://momentjs.com/">moment.js</a> - makes working with JavaScript dates so much better.</li>
        <li><a href="http://fgnass.github.io/spin.js/">spin.js</a> - used to indicate when data is being loaded. A
          simple "data loading..." message would also work. It's too bad <a
              href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2013/04/its-the-end-of-the-blink-tag-as-we-know-it/">firefox removed the
            blink tag</a>.
